Police in Brussels have surrounded a man wearing a "long coat and wires," a spokesman has told local media.
The man is understood to have been spotted acting suspiciously near  Place de la Monnaie in the Belgian capital. 
Police said the situation was "under control" but that they have not arrested the suspect. 
They were alerted after a security guard saw the man was wearing a long winter coat on a hot day. 
A bomb squad has been called to the scene and nearby shops evacuated. 
There is already heightened security in Brussels ahead of its National Day festivities on Thursday. 
We decided to take no risks," a police spokesman said.
Another spokesman said the bomb disposal unit was still attending to the incident. 
We got a call about someone acting suspiciously. Someone with a heavy winter coat - in these temperatures it's very suspicious," Christian De Coninck of Brussels police told Belgian TV.
And there were wires coming out of the coat too... we didn't take any risks. The person was stopped and kept at a distance.
We are now waiting for more information from the bomb disposal unit which is at the scene now and then we'll know more."
