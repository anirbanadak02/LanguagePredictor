The couple, who also have two sons aged 25 and 26, recently separated and had just sold the smart detached five bedroom home where they had lived for the last 15-years.
Friends of the pair said they believed Lance had been had been struggling to move on with his life following the breakdown of the marriage, but they were still deeply shocked by the incident.
One of the family’s neighbours said: “He seemed a happy nice man. He had done a lot of work on the house himself, but it had recently gone on the market and had been sold."
Another neighbour said: “They were a lovely family I'm honestly shocked. Lance couldn't do enough for you. He helped me with DIY in my house, did his all up from scratch.
A builder, who was just yards from the scene of the shooting, described how he and a lifeguard from the swimming pool had raced to help, but were too late to help the two women.
He said: “The older woman was very badly injured and I tried CPR on her while the guy from the swimming baths tried on the younger woman who didn't look as bad.”
An air ambulance was scrambled to the scene and but paramedics were unable to save them and all three were pronounced dead a short time later.
